[Chinese-ScriptsRA2]
0=0 - 攻击,1,0,1,攻击某类目标，直至无法找到目标或弹药耗尽。FireOnce=yes武器的单位在攻击一次后会跳转至下一条脚本。寻敌受到寻路的影响，只会攻击自己所在「区域」的敌人，如海军不会主动攻击陆地目标。寻敌的范围受到TargetDistanceCoefficientDefault的影响，一定范围内若没有找到目标，则会攻击UID最小的目标对象。飞行器类不能使用参数中的0、1、8，不要让飞行器类攻击没有视野(玩家视野)的目标。
1=1 - 攻击路径点,2,0,1,攻击指定路径点(上的对象)。AI的间谍类单位(渗透、占领、C4、驻扎、突击者)能够正常攻击、驻扎建筑，人类玩家的不行。对于普通单位，则会攻击并追击路径点上存在的任何对象直至对象消失(包括进入载具)，如果该对象是友军，则会在原地锁定直至对象消失，人类玩家单位会攻击友军。
2=2 - 暴走(无效),0,1,0,小队的半机械人成员会暴走(无效)。
3=3 - 移动到路径点,2,0,1,移动到指定路径点。当小队起始位置距离目标路径点低于Stray时，会认为已经抵达了目标从而直接跳过脚本。如果小队规模过大，可以适当增大Stray以降低集结卡住的概率。Jumpjet类单位移动时，在所有单位进入路径点Stray*2的距离时即会认为已经完成移动。武直需要添加BalloonHover=yes才能正常移动。飞行器使用时，需要将Stray最低设置为3，不要在多飞行器小队中使用。如果小队设置Aggressive=yes且Suicide=no，则会在所有小队成员GuardRange(一般为主武器射程)内存在敌人时，跳过该脚本。
4=4 - 移动到坐标,20,0,1,移动到坐标点(x+y*128， x，y∈[0，127])。在phobos中，算法为(x+y*1000，  x，y∈[0，999])。
5=5 - 警戒(时间计数),25,0,1,原地警戒(Guard) X 秒。
6=6 - 脚本转到行号 X,3,0,1,跳转到脚本的第 X 行(从1开始)，用来循环。
7=7 - 玩家胜利,0,0,0,使玩家胜利。

9=9 - 部署,0,0,0,所有可部署单位进行部署，会尝试驱散阻挡的友军单位。
10=10 - 跟随友军单位,0,0,0,令小队跟随最近的友军单位。移动到友军单位附近后完成脚本。
11=11 - 进入...状态,19,0,1,小队所有成员执行指定任务。成员会一直执行这个脚本。
12=12 - 设置全局变量,5,0,1,设置一个全局变量。
13=13 - 进入空闲动画,31,0,1,让小队中的步兵单位闲置(播放闲置动画)。
14=14 - 装载入运输载具,0,0,0,如果存在载员和未装满载具，则要求载员进入载具，但不考虑载具SizeLimit，也不考虑剩余位置能否装下载员，可能会因装载而卡住。在装载完所有成员、载具被装满、不存在载具时结束该动作。如果条件不能被满足，脚本会卡在这里。若存在多个载具，会将特遣中行数最靠下的载具视为载具，无视其他条件。
15=15 - 间谍进入路径点的建筑物,2,0,1,玩家和AI的间谍、工程师可以占领/渗透目标，C4无法正常使用，大兵会攻击而不是驻扎。对于普通单位，则会攻击并追击路径点上存在的任何对象直至对象消失(包括进入载具)，如果该对象是友军，则会在原地锁定直至对象消失，人类玩家单位会攻击友军。如果路径点上没有任何单位，脚本会卡在这里，直至出现单位。
16=16 - 巡逻至路径点,2,0,1,小队成员移动攻击到指定路径点，会积极攻击射程内的敌人。其余表现同脚本3 - 移动到路径点。
17=17 - 更改应用脚本(无效),6,1,0,让小队使用新的脚本(参数为动作脚本ID)
18=18 - 更改小队,7,0,1,让小队更改小队类型，如果新小队的特遣与本小队成员有重叠，则会依据招募逻辑招募这些成员，并且改变成员的分组(即使新小队没有勾选忽视分组)，其余成员会被解散。参数为包含ai(md)中小队的从0开始的索引。
19=19 - 惊慌,0,0,0,让小队所有步兵惊慌一次，Fraidycat=yes的步兵会使用Panic序列，其余步兵会卧倒。
20=20 - 更改所属方,13,0,1,小队成员全部更改为特定所属方(参数为国家编号)。
21=21 - 分散,0,0,0,让所有单位分散，类似于玩家按X。
22=22 - 进入周围的黑幕,0,0,0,让所有单位逃到有黑幕的地方。车辆成员会在执行中获得移动攻击能力。
23=23 - 玩家失败,0,0,0,使玩家失败。
24=24 - 播放语音(无效),9,1,0,播放特定的EVA语音(无效)。
25=25 - 播放音效,10,0,1,播放特定的音效。参数为sound(md)中[SoundList]的索引。
26=26 - 播放电影,11,0,1,播放特定的电影。参数为art(md)中[Movies]的索引。
27=27 - 播放音乐,12,0,1,播放特定的音乐。参数为theme(md)中[Themes]的索引。
28=28 - 删除矿石,0,0,0,删除所有成员脚下的矿石。
29=29 - 建造开始,0,0,0,让所属方开始建造建筑物，效果同触发行为3。IQ>Production的所属方始终会自动建造，不需要本脚本。
30=30 - 卖掉全部建筑,0,0,0,让AI所属方变卖所有建筑并让所有单位进入寻敌(Hunt)状态，效果同触发行为9。
31=31 - 小队自毁,0,0,0,让该小队所有成员自毁，会触发死亡武器，会播放Unit Lost语音。
32=32 - 闪电风暴开始,0,0,0,在地图上随机位置产生一次闪电风暴，可能产生在地图外。
33=33 - 闪电风暴结束,0,0,0,使闪电风暴结束。对执行时机的要求很高，需要在闪电云产生的前一瞬间至结束前执行。会立刻终止后续闪电云的产生，并且使光照变暗的时间缩短，但是不能终止音效的播放。
34=34 - 镜头聚焦小队,26,0,1,镜头聚焦此刻小队所在位置(参数为速度)。
35=35 - 重置地图黑幕,0,0,0,重置地图黑幕。
36=36 - 显示全地图,0,0,0,显示全地图。
37=37 - 删除小队成员,0,0,0,删除该小队所有成员，成员凭空消失，不会触发Unit Lost语音。
38=38 - 清除全局变量,5,0,1,清除指定全局变量。
39=39 - 设置局部变量,14,0,1,设置指定局部变量。
40=40 - 清除局部变量,14,0,1,清除指定局部变量。
41=41 - 镇定,0,0,0,使所有小队成员停止惊慌。
42=42 - 强制面向,15,0,1,强制小队成员面向一个特定的方向，执行后立即跳转至下一条，不会等待转向完成。
43=43 - 等待到满载,0,0,0,等到所有运输载具满载，不要在装载车辆时使用。
44=44 - 卡车卸载(TRUCKB->TRUCKA),0,0,0,让成员中所有TRUCKB变为TRUCKA。此逻辑基本等同于ares的变形逻辑，不仅会改变外观，还会改变绝大多数单位属性。AI触发条件只会考虑初始单位类型。
45=45 - 卡车装载(TRUCKA->TRUCKB),0,0,0,让成员中所有TRUCKA变为TRUCKB。此逻辑基本等同于ares的变形逻辑，不仅会改变外观，还会改变绝大多数单位属性。AI触发条件只会考虑初始单位类型。
46=46 - 攻击敌方建筑物,16,0,1,攻击指定类型的建筑，参数为建筑索引+系数。只会攻击一个建筑，目标被摧毁后执行下一条脚本。会将结盟的中立阵营目标纳入考虑。不会考虑寻路，海军可以使用它攻击陆地单位，但也有可能打不到。AI间谍类单位(渗透、占领、C4、驻扎、突击者)能够正常攻击、驻扎建筑，人类玩家除C4外无法正常使用。
47=47 - 移动到敌方建筑物,16,0,1,移动到指定类型的建筑，参数为建筑索引+系数。会将结盟的中立阵营目标纳入考虑。
48=48 - 侦察,0,0,0,小队会侦察玩家未探索的区域。如果要持续侦查，应当循环执行此脚本。

;19058=19058 - 移动到己方建筑(ID) (Phobos pr 1901),47,0,1,移动到己方的特定建筑。
